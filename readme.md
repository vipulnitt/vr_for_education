## About Pale Dots

> If you look at it, you see a dot. That‘s here. That’s home. That‘s us. On it, everyone you ever heard of,  every human being who ever lived, lived out their lives. The aggregate of all our joys and sufferings, … every saint and sinner in the history of our species, lived there on a mote of dust, suspended in a sunbeam.
